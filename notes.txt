TODO LIST:
----------------------------------------
organization stuff
[-] individual player graphs / stats rather than calling all at once
    OR display team graphs / stats
[-] toggle between games / select all games

data stuff
[-] figure out if correct files got uploaded --> auto-populate players / games
[-] figure out how to organize player data / team data by game or all at once

kinda both - this might actually be really annoying idk tho
[-] adjustable huck distance
[-] adjustable "short throw" distance

FOR EACH PLAYER:
- header: { total receptions, total yards, total goals, total drops }
- touchmap graph
- throwing & receiving vertical yard histogram

FOR TEAM:
- header: { all throws, non-scoring completions, assists, turnovers }
- vertical yards / likelihood per distance of completion %, assist %, turn %
- all midfield huck, sideline huck, sideline short, redzone, other passes
- same ^ but normalized

- O line specific graphs
- D line specific graphs

PER GAME:
- heatmap of playtime

PLAYER EFFICIENCY GRAPHS [ attempts / completion % ] :
- hucks
- sideline
- redzone
- other
- initiation
